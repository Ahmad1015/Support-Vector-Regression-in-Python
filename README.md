# Support Vector Regression (SVR) - Python Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR) using Python. SVR is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, and it's particularly effective when dealing with non-linear relationships between variables.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to understand and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
## Code Overview
The Python script contains the following key steps:

- Importing Libraries: We start by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, and pandas.

- Importing the Dataset: The code reads a dataset named 'Position_Salaries.csv' using pandas. It extracts the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y) from the dataset.

- Feature Scaling: SVR requires feature scaling. We standardize the features using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

- Training the SVR Model: We create an SVR regressor with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and train it on the standardized dataset.

- Predicting a New Result: We use the trained SVR model to predict a new result, which in this case is the salary for a given position level (e.g., 6.5).

- Visualizing the SVR Results: We create two plots to visualize the SVR results. The first plot shows the actual data points (red dots) and the SVR predictions (blue line). The second plot provides a smoother curve for the SVR predictions over a higher-resolution range of position levels.

## Usage
To run the code:

- Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

- Place your dataset (in this case, 'Position_Salaries.csv') in the same directory as the Python script.

- Open the Python script in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code).

- Run the script. It will execute the SVR model training, prediction, and visualization.

- Observe the SVR predictions and plots to understand the regression results.
